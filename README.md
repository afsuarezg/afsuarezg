# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **AndrÃ©s Felipe SuÃ¡rez**, a JSD candidate at Stanford Law School with a passion for bridging the gap between legal expertise and artificial intelligence technology.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Doctor of the Science of Law (JSD) at Stanford Law School, where I'm also completing coursework for a PhD minor in Computer Science. My interdisciplinary background combines law, economics, and AI technology, allowing me to explore how artificial intelligence can address practical challenges in the legal field.

## My Journey

My path began in Colombia, where I advised public authorities on legal and economic issues, handled cases before competition authorities, and taught at leading universities. However, I often found myself frustrated by how opaque and inefficient many legal processes remained. This frustration sparked my curiosity: could technology improve how legal professionals access information, make decisions, and serve their communities?

This question led me to Stanford, where I've been exploring AI and machine learning through formal studies and research projects, motivated by my interest in developing applications to enhance access to the legal system.

## What I Do

ðŸ”­ **Currently working on** - My JSD research at Stanford Law School, focusing on AI applications in legal technology and access to justice.

ðŸŒ± **Currently learning** - Advanced machine learning techniques, natural language processing, and their applications in legal systems.

ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to collaborate on** - Projects that leverage AI to improve legal processes, enhance access to justice, and bridge the gap between technology and law.

## Key Projects

**AI Legal Research Tool** (2023-2024)
- Prototyped an AI-powered legal research tool to enhance case law retrieval efficiency
- Processed approximately 40,000 legal decisions from Colombia's Constitutional Court
- Implemented embedding methods, search techniques, and evaluation frameworks
- Achieved encouraging results when compared to expert-identified ideal outcomes

## Teaching & Knowledge Sharing

I've designed and taught workshops for judges and legal practitioners in Colombia, helping them understand AI's capabilities, limitations, and ethical implications. Recent teaching includes:

- **Artificial Intelligence: Fundamentals, Ethics and Applications** at Universidad ICESI
- **Artificial Intelligence for the Administration of Justice** at Universidad de los Andes

## My Approach

I believe in:
- **Interdisciplinary thinking** - Combining legal expertise with technical innovation
- **Practical application** - Developing solutions that address real-world legal challenges
- **Ethical AI** - Ensuring technology serves justice and improves access to legal systems
- **Knowledge sharing** - Helping legal professionals understand and leverage AI tools

## What I Bring

- **Legal expertise** - Deep understanding of legal systems and processes
- **Technical skills** - Proficiency in machine learning, NLP, and AI development
- **Research experience** - Academic background in law, economics, and computer science
- **Teaching ability** - Experience training legal professionals on AI applications

## Education

- **JSD Candidate** - Stanford Law School (2021-Present)
- **PhD Minor in Computer Science** - Stanford University (Pending approval)
- **Master of the Science of Law** - Stanford University (2019)
- **Master's in Economics** - Universidad de los Andes (2019)
- **Bachelor's in Economics** - Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (2014)
- **Bachelor's in Law** - Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (2014)
