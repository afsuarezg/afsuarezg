# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **AndrÃ©s Felipe SuÃ¡rez**, a JSD candidate at Stanford Law School with a passion for improving access to legal systems through the use of artificial intelligence.

## About Me

In addition to currently pursuing the Doctor of the Science of Law (JSD) at Stanford Law School, I have also completed coursework required for a PhD minor in Computer Science, and previously obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in both law and economics. My interdisciplinary background, combining law, economics, and computer science, allows me to explore how artificial intelligence can address practical challenges in the legal field.

## What I Do

ðŸŒ± **Currently learning** - Training LLMs from scratch, fine-tuning and continued pretraining for domain-specific use cases

ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to collaborate on** - Projects that leverage AI to improve legal processes, enhance access to justice, and bridge the gap between technology and law

## Key Projects

**AI Legal Research Tool** (2023-2024)
- Prototyped an AI-powered legal research tool to enhance case law retrieval efficiency
- Processed approximately 40,000 legal decisions from Colombia's Constitutional Court
- Implemented embedding methods, search techniques, and evaluation frameworks

## Let's Connect

ðŸ¤” **Looking for help with** - Opportunities to apply AI technology to legal challenges and improve access to justice

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** - Legal technology, AI applications in law, machine learning for legal research, or bridging technology and legal systems
